  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the EXT_INT 
    driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for EXT_INT. 
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.170.0
        Device            :  PIC24FV32KA302
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.61
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.45
